# Weatherio_WeatherApp
I have done this project for my third year Web Course by following the tutorial from "codewithsadee". <br>
Here's the reference video link: https://youtu.be/QMwyNnjAils?si=iZT7oyMr0ce0PSmA<br>
I've integrated openweathermap api and with the help of it, this weather app will show us realtime Weather data, as well as forecasts for the next 5 days, Air Quality index,
<br>Humidity, Pressure level, Visibility and Feels like.
